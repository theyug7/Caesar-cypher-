# Caesar-cypher-
A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter by a ﬁxed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so ’B’ rotated by 2 is ’D’ and ’Z’ rotated by 2 is ’B’. To rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount. For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly”.  Fun fact: In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship computer is called HAL,  which is IBM rotated by -1.  Write a function called ceaser_cypher that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount.
